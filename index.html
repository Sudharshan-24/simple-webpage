        Steve Jobs is the most captivating communicator on the world stage. 
        No one else comes close. A Jobs presentation unleashes a rush of dopamine into the brains of his audience. 
        Some people go to great lengths to get this hit, even spending the night in freezing temperatures to ensure the best seat at one of his speeches. 
        When they don’t get that buzz, they go through withdrawals. How else do you explain the fact that some fans threatened to protest Jobs’s absence 
        from a conference he had keynoted for years? That’s what happened when Apple announced that Jobs would not deliver his traditional keynote presentation 
        at Macworld Expo in 2009. (Apple also announced that it would be the last year in which the company would participate in this annual trade show produced by Boston-based IDG World Expo.)
